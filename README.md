## About Me
I am a passionate video game developer interested in both art and programming. I have dedicated my career to indie game development using the Unity game engine and various design programs.

Currently, I am studying Systems Engineering and Computer Science at the National University of Colombia. I am a teaching assistant for the Multimedia Creation course and I am also part of the Turing Box student group, where I serve as the leader of the video game creation node.
